# Claude Instructions

## Elegance Principle
For each proposed change, examine the existing system and redesign it into the most elegant solution that would have emerged if the change had been a foundational assumption from the start.

## Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode.
- Run `npm run build` before committing.
- Workflow agents are the core product — changes must be backward-compatible.
